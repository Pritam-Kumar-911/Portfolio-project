# 🚀 AI-Powered Developer Portfolio

A next-generation developer portfolio that goes beyond static projects and text.
This site integrates an AI-driven chatbot trained on a curated personal dataset (knowledge.json), enabling interactive conversations about my background, skills, and projects.

Unlike typical portfolios, this project combines full-stack development, cloud deployment with custom domain name, and custom AI integration to create a dynamic, intelligent experience for visitors.
